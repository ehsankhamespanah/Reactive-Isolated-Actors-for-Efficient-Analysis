Message of the paper:

The actor-based language, Rebeca, provides a usable and analyzable model for distributed, concurrent, event-based asynchronous systems (Cyber-Physical systems).

Distributed systems  are defined like this

Reactive systems are defined like this

OLDER TEXT:

Floating Time Transition System is a natural event-based semantics for timed actors, giving us a significant amount of reduction in the state space, using a non-trivial novel idea.
